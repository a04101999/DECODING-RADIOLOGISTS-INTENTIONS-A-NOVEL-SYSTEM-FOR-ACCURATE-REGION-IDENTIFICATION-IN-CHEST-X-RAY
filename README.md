Radiologist intension detection using Large language models 
The code will be available here soon. 
## Abstract:

In the realm of chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis, radiologists meticulously examine various regions, documenting
their observations in reports. The prevalence of errors in
CXR diagnoses, particularly among inexperienced radiologists and hospital residents, underscores the importance of
understanding radiologists’ intentions and the corresponding
regions of interest. This understanding is crucial for correcting mistakes by guiding radiologists to the accurate regions of
interest, especially in the diagnosis of chest radiograph abnormalities. In response to this imperative, we propose a novel
system designed to identify the primary intentions articulated
by radiologists in their reports and the corresponding regions
of interest in CXR images. This system seeks to elucidate
the visual context underlying radiologists’ textual findings,
with the potential to rectify errors made by less experienced
practitioners and direct them to precise regions of interest.
Importantly, the proposed system can be instrumental in providing constructive feedback to inexperienced radiologists or
junior residents in the hospital, bridging the gap in face-toface communication. The system represents a valuable tool
for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and fostering continuous
learning within the medical community.
